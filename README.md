# SalesLoft Code Challenge

This is my solution to the SalesLoft Code Challenges

It's a simple app that uses:
- Ruby: 2.7
- Rails: 6
- React 17

For testing I went with:
- Minitest (for Ruby :gem:)
- Jest (fo JS)

## How to review:

In order to make it easy to review, I did progressive-commits and used the Git-flow to encapsulate
the important commits into a PR.

It just happens that trying to go commit by commit at master branch is not easy, or at least GitHub
does not provide a friendly UI to do so.

That's why I opted for creating a PR.

I'd recommend to review this challenge in the following way:

1. [Go to the PR with the important code](https://github.com/EduardoGHdez/challenge/pull/2)
2. Just review commit by commit.
